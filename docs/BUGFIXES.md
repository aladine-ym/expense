# Bug Fixes - Data Fetching Issues

## Date: October 16, 2025

### Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. **Function Declaration Scope Error in main.js** ❌ FIXED
**Location:** `public/js/main.js` lines 21-64

**Problem:**
- The `bootstrapData()` function was defined **inside** the `initApp()` function
- It was called on line 31 but defined on line 34
- This created a malformed code structure with the function interrupting the flow

**Fix:**
- Moved `bootstrapData()` function outside and before `initApp()`
- Added proper async/await error handling
- Added user feedback via toast notifications for failures

**Impact:** HIGH - This was preventing the app from loading data correctly

---

#### 2. **Data Mapping Error in notes.js** ❌ FIXED
**Location:** `server/routes/notes.js` line 144

**Problem:**
- The `mapNoteRow()` function was trying to extract `.id` from items
- But items were already mapped expense objects (not raw DB rows)
- This caused the frontend to receive malformed data

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before:
items: (note.items ?? []).map((item) => item.id),

// After:
items: note.items ?? [],
```

**Impact:** HIGH - This was breaking the data structure expected by the frontend

---

#### 3. **Missing Error Handling and Logging** ❌ FIXED
**Location:** `public/js/utils/api.js`

**Problem:**
- Silent failures in `ensureSession()`, `fetchCategories()`, and `fetchNotes()`
- No console logging to debug issues
- Users had no feedback when data fetching failed

**Fix:**
- Added comprehensive console logging for all API calls
- Added detailed error messages with status codes
- Added try-catch blocks with proper error propagation
- Added user-facing toast notifications

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Improves debugging and user experience

---

#### 4. **Toast Notification System Enhancement** ✨ IMPROVED
**Location:** `public/js/ui/toast.js`

**Problem:**
- Toast system didn't support different message types (info, warning, error, success)
- No visual distinction for different severity levels

**Fix:**
- Added type parameter support: `showToast(message, type, duration)`
- Backward compatible with existing code
- Added CSS classes for styling: `toast--info`, `toast--warning`, `toast--error`, `toast--success`

**Impact:** LOW - Quality of life improvement

---

#### 5. **Debug Endpoint Added** ✨ NEW FEATURE
**Location:** `server/routes/index.js`

**Added:**
- New `/api/debug/db` endpoint to check database connectivity
- Returns count of records in each table
- Helps diagnose database issues quickly

**Usage:**
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/debug/db
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "connected",
  "tables": {
    "users": 5,
    "categories": 12,
    "notes": 23,
    "expenses": 45
  }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Data Fetching Flow
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Open browser console
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify console logs show:
   - "Ensuring session..."
   - "Guest session created for user: guest-XXXXX"
   - "Categories fetched: X"
   - "Notes fetched: X Expenses: X"

### 2. Test Error Handling
1. Stop the server
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify toast notification appears: "Using offline data..."
4. Verify app still loads with sample data

### 3. Test Database Connectivity
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/debug/db`
2. Verify response shows table counts
3. If counts are 0, run: `npm run seed`

## Remaining Issues to Investigate

### Potential Issues:
1. **Session persistence** - Check if cookies are being set correctly
2. **CORS configuration** - Verify credentials are included in requests
3. **Database initialization** - Ensure migrations run on first start
4. **Sample data loading** - Verify fallback data is correct

### Next Steps:
1. Monitor browser console for any remaining errors
2. Test with fresh database (delete .sqlite file and restart)
3. Test guest login flow
4. Test Google OAuth flow (if configured)
